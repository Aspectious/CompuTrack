# CompuTrack
Web-based ticketing program made with Node.js framework.

## Functionality:
This Web Application was designed for the EHS Help Desk/Hardware Software Maintenence Students as a means of tracking computers, assets, and issues with said assets.
It kind of sucks, it was written in javascript.
The end goal is to make a reliable way for students to access large quantities of data, without the nuisance of learning MS-Access as a Database manager.

## Developers
Currently, me (Aspectious) is the only one on this repo.
